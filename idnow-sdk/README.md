## Settings (IDnowSettings)
The settings that should be used for the identification process provided by IDnow.

#### transactionToken
A token that will be used for instantiating a photo or video identification.

#### companyID
Your company id provided by IDnow.

#### environment
Optional: The environment that should be used for the identification (DEV, TEST, LIVE)
The default value is `IDnowEnvironmentNotDefined`. 
The used environment will then base on the prefix of the transaction token (DEV -> DEV, TST -> Test, else -> Live).
You can use the special IDnowEnvironmentCustom to define a custom IDnow installation. If this is done, you need to set the apiHost and websocketHost.

#### showErrorSuccessScreen
Optional: If set to `false`, the Error-Success-Screen provided by the SDK will not be displayed.
The default value of this property is `true`.

#### showVideoOverviewCheck
Optional: If set to `false`, the video overview check screen will not be shown befsore starting a video identification.
The default value of this property is `true`.

#### forceModalPresentation
Optional: If set to `true`, the UI for the identification will always be displayed modal. 
By default the value of this property is `false` and the identification UI will be pushed on an existing navigation controller if possible.

#### modalPresentationStyle
Optional: Specifies the presentation style for the modal ident viewcontroller.
E.g. Can be set to `UIModalPresentationCurrentContext` to allow presenting ident view controller within a popover on an iPad.
 
#### apiHost
The target server url for REST calls if custom server is used.

#### websocketHost
The target server url for websocket calls if custom server is used.

#### connectionType
The connection type to use to talk the backend. (Websocket (default) or long polling)

## Branding (IDnowAppearance)
Warning: Branding is only allowed if you have the permissions from IDnow.

## Adding Push Notifications

In order to use push notifications via the IDnow SDK it is neccessary that your own AppDelegate inherits from 
the provided IDnowAppDelegate. This is neccessary since the callbacks form Apple concerning registration and 
reception of push notifications is soley handled through the AppDelegate which is not part of our SDK. In case your
own AppDelegate implements interfaces present in the IDnow SDK please make sure to make a 
call the super classes (IDnowAppDelegate) implementation as well.

Additionally we will need the production certifcate/key pair to send notifications via push to your app via
our backend.

```objective-c

// header
@interface YourAppDelegate : IDnowAppDelegate

@end

// implementation
@implementation YourAppDelegate

- (void)application:(UIApplication*)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError*)error
{
    [super application:application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:error];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:(UIUserNotificationSettings *)notificationSettings
{
	[super application:application didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:notificationSettings];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication*)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(nonnull NSData*)deviceToken
{
	[super application:application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];
}

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(nullable NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
	[super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo
{
	[super application:application didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo
                                                       fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult result))completionHandler
{
	[super application:application didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo
										 fetchCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
}

@end


```

## Usage example:

```objective-c

// Setup IDnowAppearance
IDnowAppearance *appearance = [IDnowAppearance sharedAppearance];
    
// Adjust colors
appearance.defaultTextColor = [UIColor blackColor];
appearance.primaryBrandColor = [UIColor blueColor];
appearance.proceedButtonBackgroundColor = [UIColor orangeColor];
appearance.failureColor = [UIColor redColor];
appearance.successColor = [UIColor greenColor];
    
// Adjust statusbar
appearance.enableStatusBarStyleLightContent = YES;
    
// Adjust fonts
appearance.fontNameRegular = @"AmericanTypewriter";
appearance.fontNameLight = @"AmericanTypewriter-Light";
appearance.fontNameMedium = @"AmericanTypewriter-CondensedBold";

// To adjust navigation bar / bar button items etc. you should follow Apples UIAppearance protocol.

// Setup IDnowSettings
IDnowSettings *settings = [IDnowSettings settingsWithCompanyID:@"yourCompanyIdentifier"];
settings.transactionToken = @"DEV-TXTXT";

// Initialise and start identification
IDnowController *idnowController = [[IDnowController alloc] initWithSettings: settings];

// Initialize identification using blocks 
// (alternatively you can set the delegate and implement the IDnowControllerDelegate protocol)
[idnowController initializeWithCompletionBlock: ^(BOOL success, NSError *error, BOOL canceledByUser)
{
		if ( success )
		{
		      // Start identification using blocks
			  [idnowController startIdentificationFromViewController: self 
			  withCompletionBlock: ^(BOOL success, NSError *error, BOOL canceledByUser)
			  {
					  if ( success )
					  {
					      // identification was successfull
					  }
					  else
					  {
					      // identification failed / canceled
					  }
				}];
		}
		else if ( error )
		{
		      // Present an alert containing localized error description
			  UIAlertController *alertController = [UIAlertController alertControllerWithTitle: @"Error" 
			  message: error.localizedDescription 
			  preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyleAlert];
			  UIAlertAction *action = [UIAlertAction actionWithTitle: @"Ok" 
			  style: UIAlertActionStyleCancel 
			  handler: nil];
			  [alertController addAction: action];
			  [self presentViewController: alertController animated: true completion: nil];
		}
	}];
```

You can also change some of the optional settings:

```objective-c
// Optionally disable success and error screens
settings.showErrorSuccessScreen = NO;
settings.showVideoOverviewCheck = NO;
settings.forceModalPresentation = YES;

// Optionally enable custom server with long polling
settings.environment = IDnowEnvironmentCustom;
settings.apiHost = @"https://api.yourserver.com";
settings.websocketHost = @"https://websocket.yourserver.com";
settings.connectionType = IDnowConnectionTypeLongPolling;
```

## Localization
Warning: Adapting localizations is only allowed if you have the permissions from IDnow.

English and German Localizations are provided by the SDK (IDnowSDKLocalization.bundle)
You can overwrite localisation in your own Localizable.strings files.


### Example:
```
//Defined in the IDnowSDKLocalization.bundle
"NAVIGATION_ITEM_TITLE_DEFAULT" = "IDnow";

//Overwrite in your Localizable.strings file:
"NAVIGATION_ITEM_TITLE_DEFAULT" = "Video Ident";
```
